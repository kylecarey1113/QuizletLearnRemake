Ask the user what file they want to read information from 

Read information from a text file and import it

split the information to two seperate lists called terms and definitions

make a list that is the same length as terms list (and definition list) to keep track of how many success each 'flashcard' has
    Number of successes and corresponding function
        0 - give a random term and 4 random definition. pick the correct definition
        1 - give a random definition and 4 random terms. pick the correct term
        2 - give a random definition and prompt the user to type in the corresponding term
        3 - give a rnadom term and prompt the user to type in the corresponding definition

make a function that will pick a random number from 0 to len(terms) and prompt the user
to do one of the four above things, depending on what the value in the list is
    if the random number picked corresponds with a task that is already at 3, skip that task

when the user reaches 25%, 50%, and 75% completion, tell them that they have that much of the flashcard set done.

when the entire list is full of 3s, tell the user that they have finished the flashcards

end the program
